"""
src/trading_engine.py
---------------------
Main trading engine for the Deriv Volatility 10 (1s) Bot.

Orchestrates:
  - Deriv API connection and tick subscription.
  - Quality pullback-momentum signal generation.
  - Multi-timeframe analysis (5m, 15m, 30m).
  - Trade execution with Martingale stake management.
  - Contract outcome monitoring and P&L tracking.
  - State updates for the Streamlit UI.

--- FIXES APPLIED (see audit report for full details) ---
BUG-7: API token is taken raw from a Streamlit text_input widget and passed
       directly to DerivAPIClient without stripping whitespace. Users who
       accidentally paste a token with a leading/trailing space or newline
       will always get an InvalidToken error from the API even though the
       token itself is valid. The fix strips the token before use.
